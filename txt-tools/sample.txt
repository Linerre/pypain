Thank You mr. chairman members of the

committee @I'm happy to be back in front

of the Judiciary Committee @where I

started this pilgrimage @I am going to

get even more fundamental than my good

friend and colleague @like him I I speak

to students @especially law students but

also college students and even high

school students @quite frequently about

the Constitution @because I feel that

were we're not teaching it very well

@um I speak to law students from the the

best law schools @people presumably

especially interested in the law @and I

ask them how many of you have read the

Federalist Papers @and well a lot of

hands will go out no @not just number 48

and the big ones @how many of you have

read the Federalist Papers

cover-to-cover @never more than about 5%

@and then that is very sad

I mean @if especially if you're

interested in the Constitution @here's a

document that says what the framers of

it thought they were doing @it's such a a

profound exposition of political science

@that it is studied in in political

science courses in Europe @and yet we

have raised a generation of Americans

who are not familiar with it @so when I

speak to these groups @the first point I

make @and I think it's even a little more

fundamental than the one that Stephen is

just put forward @I asked them what do

you think is the reason that America is

such a free country @what is it in our

Constitution that that that makes us

what we are @and I guarantee you that the

response I will get and you will get

this from almost any American @including

the woman that he was talking to at the

supermarket @the answer would be freedom

of speech @freedom of the press @no

unreasonable searches and seizures @no

quartering of troops in help those

marvelous provisions of the Bill of

Rights

@what did I tell them if if you think

that a bill of rights @is what sets us

apart @you're crazy

@every banana republic in the world has a

bill of rights @every president for life

has a Bill of Rights @the Bill of Rights

of the of the former evil empire the

Union of Soviet Socialist Republics @was

much better than ours @I mean it

literally @it was much better

@we guarantee freedom of speech and of

the press big deal @they guaranteed

freedom of speech of the press of street

demonstrations and protests @and anyone

who is who is caught trying to suppress

criticism of the government @will be

called to account @whoa that is wonderful

stuff @of course just words on paper @what

what our framers would have called a

parchment guarantee @and the reason is

@that the real Constitution of the Soviet

Union @you think of the word Constitution

@it doesn't mean a bill it means

structure @say a person has a sound

constant to here's a sound structure @the

real Constitution of the Soviet Union

@which is what our framers debated that

that whole summer in Philadelphia in

1787 @they didn't talk about the Bill of

Rights @that was an afterthought wasn't

it @that constitution of the Soviet Union

did not prevent the centralization of

power @in one person or in one party @and

when that happens the game is over @the

Bill of Rights is just what our framers

would call a parchment guarantee @so the

real key to the distinctiveness of

America @is the structure of our

government @one part of it of course is

the Independence of the judiciary @but

there's there's there's a lot more @there

are very few countries in the world for

example that have a bicameral

legislature @Oh England has a House of

Lords for the time being @but the House

of Lords has no substantial power @they

can just make the Commons pass a bill a

second time @France has a Senate it's

honorific @Italy has a Senate it's

honorific @very few countries have two

separate bodies in the legislature

equally powerful @that's a lot of trouble

as you gentlemen doubtless know @to get

the same language through two different

bodies elected in a different fashion

@very few countries in the world @have a a

separately elected chief executive

@sometimes i go to europe to talk about

separation of powers @and when I get

there I find that all I'm talking about

is independence of the judiciary @because

the Europeans don't even try to divide

the two political powers @the two

political branches @the legislature and

the chief executive @in all of the

parliamentary countries @the chief

executive is the creature of the

legislature @there's never any

disagreement between them and the and

and the the Prime Minister @as there is

sometimes between you and the president

@when there's a disagreement they just

kick them out @they have a no confidence

vote a new election and they get a prime

minister who agrees with the legislature

@and you know they're the Europeans look

at this system and they say well it

passes one house it doesn't pass the

other house @sometimes the other house is

in the control of a different party @it

passes both and then this president who

has a veto power @vetoes it and they look

at this and they say oh it is it is

gridlock @and and I hear Americans saying

this nowadays @and there's a lot of it

going around @they talk about a

dysfunctional government @because

there's disagreement @and they and the

framers would have said yes @that's

exactly the way we set it up @we wanted

this to be power contradicting power

@because the main the main ill that beset

us as as Hamilton said in in the

Federalist @when he talked about a

separate Senate @he said yes it seems

inconvenient @but in as much as the main

ill that besets us @is an excess of

legislation it won't be so bad @this is

1780 and he didn't know what an excess

of legislation was

@so unless Americans can appreciate that

@and learn learn to love the separation

of powers @which means learning to love

the gridlock @which the framers believed

would be the main protection of

minorities, the main protection @if a bill

is about to pass that really comes down

hard on some minority @they think it's

terribly unfair @it doesn't take much to

throw a monkey wrench into into this

into this complex system @so Americans

should should appreciate that @and they

should learn to love the gridlock @it's

it's there for a reason so that the

legislation that gets out will will be

good legislation @and thus conclude my

opening remarks

向杨 你好 我叫向杨 社会学三年级博士生。
YANG: Hi, my name's Yang, a third year in Sociology.
我的问题关于外交事务上的资质和敏锐度问题。
So my question is about qualification and sensibility in diplomacy.
[伯恩 嗯。
BURNS: Mhm.] So what sort of sensibility or set of skills that are uniquely suited for ambassadors working in countries with relatively more adversarial relationships [BURNS: Yeah.] such as Russia, as opposed to those working in countries with more friendly—even allies, such as Japan or South Korea?
]请问 具备什么样敏锐度或是综合素质的大使特别适合在与美国关系紧张的国家打交道 [伯恩 嗯。
BURNS: Right.] And what role diplomats could play as individuals to address or alleviate some anti-Americanism in some parts of these countries?

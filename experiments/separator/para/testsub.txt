YANG: Hi, my name's Yang, a third year in Sociology. So my question is about qualification and sensibility in diplomacy. [BURNS: Mhm.] So what sort of sensibility or set of skills that are uniquely suited for ambassadors working in countries with relatively more adversarial relationships [BURNS: Yeah.] such as Russia, as opposed to those working in countries with more friendly—even allies, such as Japan or South Korea? [BURNS: Right.] And what role diplomats could play as individuals to address or alleviate some anti-Americanism in some parts of these countries?
向杨：你好，我叫向杨，社会学三年级博士生。我的问题关于外交事务上的资质和敏锐度问题。[伯恩：嗯。]请问，具备什么样敏锐度或是综合素质的大使特别适合在与美国关系紧张的国家打交道，[伯恩：嗯。] 比如俄罗斯，对比那些亲美一些的国家甚至是盟友相比话，比如日本或韩国？[伯恩：嗯。] 外交官个人又能发挥什么作用来处理或是缓和这些国家的反美情绪呢？

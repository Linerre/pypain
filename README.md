I put together a small collection of scripts (mainly Python) in this repository. They are used to reduce the "boring stuff" of my daily routines.

The scripts are not intended for general use, but instead were written to target the problems I need to tackle. For example, pre-processing lengthy *.txt files for use in video subtitles; reducing the times needed when copying and pasting information from spreadsheets to a local application called ARes (Automated Course Reserves).

Some scripts also serve as prototypes that may evolve into useful tools in the end.

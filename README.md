# What
Here is a casual place to store some throw-away `.py` scripts used to reduce
repeated work during my daliy routine. 

Most of the work here are inspired and driven by the very boring parts of my
(and my colleague's) work, such as renaming a batch of files.

# Cheat
I have to admit this repo contributes a lot to my contributions graph, which
can be thought of as cheating, since some minor changes constitue many commits
to the repo.
